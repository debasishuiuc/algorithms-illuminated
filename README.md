This repository contains implementations of classic algorithms in both Python and Java, starting with content from Tim Roughgarden’s *Algorithms Illuminated* and expanding to other sources over time.

It aims to provide **clear explanations**, **step-by-step derivations**, and **performance analysis** of fundamental algorithms.
